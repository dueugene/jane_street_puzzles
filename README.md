# jane_street_puzzles
a respository for code I use to help solve [jane street puzzles](https://janestreet.com/puzzles/current-puzzle/), a monthly math/logic puzzle challenge.

some scripts are written in python, but I have since switced to c++ for future puzzles.

not all months exists, as sometimes the puzzles can be sovled without code, or I did not have time to solve it.

Description of scripts:

* jun2019: some helper functions for displaying a grid, and list of available numbers in a puzzle
* jul2019: a solver for a scrabble like game
* jan2020: a simulator for a number game
* apr2020: a solver for drawing triangles on a gird
* may2020: a solver for a number sequence problem
* aug2020: a script to parse a list of stock market ticker symbols, and find the missing symbol
* dec2020: a solver for the month's logic puzzle, uses a brute force method combined with backtracking
* jan2021: script **incomplete**
* oct2024: solver for a knights moves games
